%Research focus: Software testing techniques on hybrid systems which integrate continuous and discrete dynamics. As traditional software techniques only deal with discrete dynamics, how to mitigate the effect of continuous dynamics in hybrid systems is the main challenge. We apply some stochastic optimization techniques to smartly test the systems and find bugs.\\

%\\Research focus: software testing techniques on concurrent programs. Different from general programs, concurrent programs have more than 1 threads/processors read or write the shared memories, so different threads can conflict when they read/write the shared memories simultaneously and affect the correctness of the program. Our research is to define the correctness criteria of concurrent programs and test whether programs satisfy them.\\

\section{Research Interest}
\cventry{}{\normalfont{My research interest lies at the intersection of formal methods and software testing. My current research topic is hybrid system falsification, which aims to find a counterexample to refute the specifications of a black-box system. System requirements here are in the form of rigorous mathematics, namely, temporal logics, while methodology depends on stochastic optimization as well as artificial intelligence techniques. Prior to joining ERATOMMSD Project, my research topic is on testing concurrent data structures against correctness criterion like linearizability.}}{}{}{}{}
